# 19th-Century-US-Name-Generator
let's you generate a random list of names (based on the most common given and last names in the 1850 US census). Just a curiousity. <br/> 
I made this quite a while ago on codepen, thought I would upload it here <br/>
try it: https://cold-pac.github.io/19th-Century-US-Name-Generator/ <br/>
